Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I lerant how to center a div container

```html
<div id="container">
    <div><img src="images/image-qr-code.png"></div>
    <div>
        <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
   </div> 
```
```css
#container{
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-top: 100px;
    text-align: center;
    width: 290px;
    height: 450px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    padding: 16px;
    padding-bottom: 40px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    font-family: Outfit;
    font-weight: 400px, 70opx;
}

#container img{
    height: 288px;
    width: 288px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```


### Continued development

over time, i would focus on learning react- for improved web design and execution.
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1]([https://www.example.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2279519/how-to-get-main-div-container-to-align-to-centre)) - This helped me learn how to center align a div. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
